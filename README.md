The files that are necessary to use are these:

Mainfolder/Cypress/Integration/**scraper.spec.js** //this is the file where the Cypress testing code is set.
Mainfolder/**products.json** //this is the file to which the results are printed in json form at the end of the test. It containg information on products listed on the website, their prices and measures.

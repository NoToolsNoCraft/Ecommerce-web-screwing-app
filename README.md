# Ecommerce-web-screwing-app
Version 1 (Cypress testing):

I've begun the procedure with basic Cypress installation through the terminal: npm install cypress
After that, I created the files that weren't created by default (scraper.spec.js & products.json)

This is how my files and folders are organized:

The files that are necessary to use are these:
Mainfolder/Cypress/Integration/**scraper.spec.js** //this is the file where the Cypress testing code is set.
Mainfolder/**products.json** //This is the file to which the results are printed in JSON form at the end of the test. It contains information on products listed on the website, their prices, and their measures.
I used the Serbian Lidl domain for this testing: https://www.lidl.rs/
